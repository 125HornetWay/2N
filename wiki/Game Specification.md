# Game Specification
## Project Description
This design document describes 2^N^, a simple 2D, skill-based tile game based off the game [2048](https://play2048.co/).  This implementation includes several innovations including multiple levels of difficulty (hence the name), networked multi-player speed competitions, and support for multiple platforms.

## Board
The game itself is played on a tiled grid, the size of which is determined by the level of difficulty selected.

| Highest Tile Size | Grid Size |
|-------------------|-----------|
| 1024              | 4x4       |
| 2048              | 4x4       |
| 4096              | 6x6       |
| 8192              | 6x6       |
